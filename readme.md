# WIP - Bosch eBike Monitor

A simple Android app to connect to Bosch eBikes via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and monitor real-time data including battery level and assist mode.

Creates an android notification that can be pushed to any connected devices like Garmin Smartwatches.

Created after getting frustrated with Bosches lack of connectivity to other devices.

Others have had the same frustrations!

How does Bosch send the information via Bluetooth??

Sample message
| Message                  | Power (watts) |
|--------------------------|----------------|
| `30-04-98-5B-08-4F`      | 79 W           |
| `30-05-98-5B-08-B2-04`   | 562 W          |
| `30-02-98-5B`            | 0 W            |

## Prerequisites

- Android device with Bluetooth LE support
- Bosch eBike with Smart System
- **nRF Connect app** (for finding your bike's MAC address)

## Setup

### 1. Find Your Bike's MAC Address

1. **Download nRF Connect** from Google Play Store
2. **Turn on your bike** and ensure Bluetooth is enabled
3. **Open nRF Connect** and scan for devices
4. **Look for "SMART SYSTEM EBIKE"** in the device list
5. **Note the MAC address** (format: `XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX`)

### 2. Configure the App

1. **Clone this repository**
2. **Open in Android Studio**
3. **Build and install** the app on your Android device
4. **Grant Bluetooth permissions** when prompted

## Usage

### Connection Methods

**Option 1: Direct Connection (Fastest)**
1. Open the app
2. Enter your bike's MAC address in the "Direct Connection" field
3. Tap "Connect to This MAC"

**Option 2: Device Scanning**
1. Tap "Scan Devices"
2. Wait for your bike to appear in the list
3. Tap on your bike to connect

### Live Data Display

Once connected, you'll see:
- **🚴 Live Bike Status** - Current assist mode and battery levels
- **📡 Raw Data** - Latest data packet received
- **📋 Data Log** - Timestamped history of all data

## Supported Data

The app currently decodes:
- **Battery Level**: Two different battery value formats
- **Assist Mode**: Current motor assistance level (0-5)
- **Raw Telemetry**: All received data packets for analysis

## Troubleshooting

- **Can't find bike**: Ensure bike is on and close to your phone
- **Connection fails**: Try the direct MAC address method
- **No data**: Check that Bosch Flow app isn't blocking the connection

## Development

Built with:
- Kotlin
- Android Jetpack Compose
- Android Bluetooth LE APIs

- CLAUDE.ai

# TO DO LIST

- Hardcoded UUIDs: Bosch service UUIDs look suspicious - custom/placeholder UUIDs rather than official Bosch ones - investigate? read from BLE service?
- Data parsing assumptions: The battery/assist parsing logic makes assumptions about packet structure that may not be correct
- No error recovery: Limited handling of connection failures or data corruption

*UI*
- choose which fields are output as BLE sources (speed/cadence/ebike data)
- choose which fields are output as notifications upon change (battery percentage?)

*Note: This app works alongside the official Bosch Flow app. Make sure your bike is authenticated and unlocked via Flow before connecting.*
